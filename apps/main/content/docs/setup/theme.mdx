title: FusionAuth Theme Setup
description: Upload a demo's theme files to your FusionAuth instance
---

Each Demo in this repository come with a set of FusionAuth theme templates to customize all aspects of the hosted FusionAuth pages.

The theme templates are located in named directories within `/packages/fusionauth/`. The name of the subdirectory corresponds to the name of each Next.js app.

<Callout>
**Prerequisites** 
* Node 22.6.0 or higher
* [FusionAuth CLI](https://fusionauth.io/docs/customize/cli)
</Callout>


If you wish to use CLI flags instead, the API key flag is `-k` and the host flag is `-h`

## Find the theme ID

During the [setup process](), the `fa:setup` created a new advanced theme in your FusionAuth dashboard. The theme does not contain the proper styles or templates. To get the files to FusionAuth for hosted pages, we need to the theme ID.

With your Docker container running, navigate to the [Customization > Theme dashboard](http://localhost:9011/admin/theme/).

Each theme has a unique ID. For your demo, copy the ID that corresponds to the demo name.

## Uploading the demo's theme files

The template files for each theme exist in `/packages/fusionauth/<theme-name>`. In your terminal, change directory into `/packages/fusionauth` and run the upload command changing out the following variables:

* `<theme-id>`: Repace this with the ID from the admin from the previous section
* `<tpl-directory>`: The relative path to the files for the templates (e.g. `./tacostruck/tpl`)
* `<apikey>`: The API key for your FusionAuth API (found in the admin or created during setup)
* `<host>`: The host for FusionAuth (for local work `http://localhost:9011`)
```sh
npx fusionauth theme:upload <theme-id> -i <tpl-directory> -k <apikey> -h <host>
```

Once this runs, the various FusionAuth pages in your locally running app should show the proper theme styles.

This should be all you need to be up and running. The following sections detail doing more work on the themes.

## Additional Details

### Download

> Note: If you are on a newer version or upgrade your FusionAuth Instance, make sure you either download the theme manually or update all the required messages.

```sh
cd <theme-directory>
npx fusionauth theme:download <theme-id> -k <apikey> -h <host> -o <tpl-directory>
```

Example:
```sh
npx fusionauth theme:download e753828b-b475-44f3-8727-39749c2f36e3 -k this_really_should_be_a_long_random_alphanumeric_value_but_this_still_works -h http://localhost:9011 -o ./iron-pixel/tpl
```


### Watching Changes and Rebuilding Themes

> More details: https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-node-cli
> Make sure you update to the CORRECT theme directory!!!
> Note: You need to replace `<themeid>`, `<apikey>`, `<host>` and `<theme-name>` with your own values.

This will require two steps, one for building using Tailwind and the other for uploading to FusionAuth.

#### Building CSS from Tailwind
> See more: https://fusionauth.io/docs/customize/look-and-feel/tailwind

Run the below command to watch for changes and rebuild the theme: 
```sh
npx @tailwindcss/cli -i ./<theme-name>/input.css -o ./<theme-name>/tpl/stylesheet.css --watch
```

Example:
```sh
npx @tailwindcss/cli -i ./iron-pixel/input.css -o ./iron-pixel/tpl/stylesheet.css --watch
```

#### Uploading to FusionAuth

Run this command in another terminal to automatically update the theme within FusionAuth Instance:
```sh
npx fusionauth theme:watch <themeid> -k <apikey> -h <host> -i ./<theme-name>/tpl/
```

Example:
```sh
npx fusionauth theme:watch e753828b-b475-44f3-8727-39749c2f36e3 -k this_really_should_be_a_long_random_alphanumeric_value_but_this_still_works -h http://localhost:9011 -i ./iron-pixel/tpl/
```
