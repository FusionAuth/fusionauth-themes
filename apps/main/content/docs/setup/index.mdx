  Prerequisites: 
  - Node 22.6.0 or higher to run scripts without compiling TypeScript.
  - Docker to run FusionAuth locally (you can skip this if you already have a FusionAuth instance up and running)
  - [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation#using-npm) to install and run scripts instead of NPM
</Callout>


## Install the demos

Clone the repository and install its requirements:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-themes

cd fusionauththemes

pnpm install
```

## Set up FusionAuth Docker container

The FusionAuth setup is created via a mix of Docker, FusionAuth Kickstart, and a setup script.

The FusionAuth Docker files are located in the `fusionauth` directory. This directory contains the Docker compose file and the Kickstart information. 

### Environment variables 

The setup requires certain environment variables, those are contained in the `.env.example` file. Rename that file to `.env`.

### Run Docker

Move into the `fusionauth` directory and run the Docker container.

```bash
cd fusionauth

docker compose up -d
```

After running these commands, there should be a version of FusionAuth running in your Docker engine. It's now ready to be populated for your demo.

### Run the setup script

Once the Docker container is running, you can run the setup script from the root directory of the project.

```bash
cd ..

pnpm fa:setup
```

The setup script will ask you questions. The default values will be what you want, but **_must be copied and pasted from the terminal inputs_**.

* **App Name**: The directory name of the demo app in the `/apps/` directory.
* **API Key**: Any key you want, but to follow other tutorials, use `this_really_should_be_a_long_random_alphanumeric_value_but_this_still_works`
* **API Endpoint**: Where your FusionAuth URL is `http://localhost:9011`
* **Admin Email**: Your FusionAuth admin email: `admin@example.com`
* **Admin Password**: Your FusionAuth admin password: `password`
* **Redirect URI**: Proper redirect URL for your app. Each app runs on a different port, so make sure to change it to the correct port `http://localhost:3001/api/auth/callback/fusionauth`
  * `main`: 3000
  * `iron-pixel`: 3001
  * `changebank`: 3002
  * `finexa`: 3003
  * `tacostruck`: 3004

Once the setup script finishes, it will give you a list of environment variables for your project. Copy those variables from your terminal into the appropriate app's `.env` file.

If the script asks you if you want to delete data, answer "No"

In your FusionAuth instance, log in with the admin credentials, navigate to your Tenants -> Default Tenant, and edit that tenant. In the Issuer field, add `http://localhost:9011`.

## Next steps

At this point, the FusionAuth app and the Next.js app should both be running and working together. If you don't need a branded set of FusionAuth themes for your demo, you can stop here.

Each demo contains the files you need to do a fully-branded theme for the hosted FusionAuth pages.
